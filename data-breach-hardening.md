# Security risk assessment report 

| Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement |  |
| :---- | ----- |
| The following hardening tools were used: firewall maintenance, multi-factor authentication (MFA), network access privileges and password policies |  |
|  |  |

| Part 2: Explain your recommendations |
| :---- |
| 1\. **Network Access Privileges**: The company employers share passwords which allows anyone to access the data which weakens the security of the data. Network Access Privileges helps by permitting, limiting and blocking access of unauthorized users to internal networks.  2\. **Password Policies**: strong password policies should be put in place and password management policies should be implemented and updated. Rules such as using a long password which must include symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters should be implemented. This policies helps prevent attackers from easily guessing user passwords by trying all possible password that can be used ( called Brute Force Attack) 3\. **Multi-factor Authentication**: This adds an extra layer of protection by asking a user to verify their identity to access a system or network. It can be through biometrics like fingerprints, one-time password (OTP), authenticator apps , e.t.c. It prevents attacks like brute force attacks. 4\. **Firewall Maintenance**: The firewalls do not have rules to filter incoming and outgoing traffic. If the firewall is constantly checked and updated regularly this stays ahead of potential threats, it prevents abnormal network traffic into the network. It can also be used to prevent a DDoS Attack.  |
